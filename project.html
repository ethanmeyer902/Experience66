    <h2 id="description">Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      As we approach the 100-year anniversary of Route 66, an important question arises:
      how can we effectively showcase its history, landmarks, and everything it has to offer?
      Our team has decided to develop a solution that enables users to experience the rich
      history of Route 66 through a dedicated mobile application.
    </p>

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
    <p>
      To address this challenge, our team was tasked with creating a mobile application
      that provides seamless access to the history, data, and cultural significance of Route 66.
      The app will allow users to explore this information at their fingertipsâ€”whether
      stationary or on the move. A key feature will be geofencing, which enhances the
      experience by triggering location-specific content as users travel along Route 66.
    </p>

    <!-- Technologies Section -->
    <h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
    <p>The following tools and platforms will be used to implement the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ArcGIS:</strong> Used for the map component of the app, providing location-based services and interactive mapping. This solution was recommended by our client.</li>
      <li><strong>Java:</strong> Chosen as the primary programming language because of its compatibility with ArcGIS and suitability for mobile app development.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Our version control and collaborative code-sharing platform, enabling efficient teamwork and project management.</li>
      <li><strong>NAU Archives:</strong> Serving as our database pool, from which we will pull historical data and resources related to Route 66.</li>
    </ul>
